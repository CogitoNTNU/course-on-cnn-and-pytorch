# Course on CNN and Pytorch
Welcome to the "Course on CNN and PyTorch," a structured educational resource designed to deepen your understanding and practical skills with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch.

## Course Overview
This course is structured to provide a step-by-step introduction to the core concepts of deep learning, focusing on CNNs and their implementation in PyTorch. Through this course, you will gain hands-on experience working with datasets, implementing CNN architectures, and training deep learning models efficiently.

## What You Will Learn
* **Introduction to Deep Learning:** Fundamental concepts and applications of deep learning.
* **Datasets and DataLoaders:** How to load, preprocess, and utilize datasets with PyTorch DataLoaders.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Architecture, functionality, and significance of Convolutional Neural Networks.
* **Training Loop:** Detailed walkthrough of the training process, including loss calculation and model optimization.
* **Specific CNN Architectures:** Exploration of various CNN designs and their applications.

## Course Features
* **Hands-on Learning:** Engage with practical exercises and projects to apply what you learn.
* **Comprehensive Material:** Access detailed lectures and notes covering all aspects of deep learning and CNNs.

## Prerequisites
* **Python Programming:** Basic understanding of Python programming.
* **Google Account:** Access to Google Colab for running the code on a T-4 GPU.

## How to Use This Notebook
To use this notebook, you can clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab. To be able to train the networks in a reasonable time, one must use a T-4 GPU. 
One must change the hosted runtime to a T-4 GPU by clicking on the "connection" tab and then "Change runtime type" and then select "GPU" and "T-4" as shown in the images 
below.
