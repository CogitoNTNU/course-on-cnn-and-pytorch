# Course on CNN and Pytorch
Welcome to the "Course on CNN and PyTorch" a structured educational resource designed to deepen your understanding and practical skills with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using PyTorch.

## Course Overview
This course is structured to provide a step-by-step introduction to the core concepts of deep learning, focusing on CNNs and their implementation in PyTorch. Through this course, you will gain hands-on experience working with datasets, implementing CNN architectures, and training deep learning models efficiently.

## What You Will Learn
* **Introduction to Deep Learning:** Fundamental concepts and applications of deep learning.
* **Datasets and DataLoaders:** How to load, preprocess, and utilize datasets with PyTorch DataLoaders.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Architecture, functionality, and significance of Convolutional Neural Networks.
* **Training Loop:** Detailed walkthrough of the training process, including loss calculation and model optimization.
* **Specific CNN Architectures:** Exploration of various CNN designs and their applications.


## Prerequisites
* **Python Programming:** Basic understanding of Python programming.
* **Google Account:** Access to Google Colab for running the code on a T4 GPU.

## How to Use This Notebook
To use this notebook, you open the notebook in Google Colab.
To ensure your models train efficiently, you'll want to use a T4 GPU provided by Google Colab. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Select Runtime Type:** After opening the notebook in Colab, navigate to the "Runtime" menu at the top of the page.
2. **Change Runtime Type:** Click on "Change runtime type" in the drop-down menu.
3. **Enable GPU:** In the dialog that appears, set "Hardware accelerator" to "GPU" and ensure that it's set to use a T4 GPU.
